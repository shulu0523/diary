# System Thinking
- We think about them in terms of more flows. 
  How does information move through the system? How are behaviors changed through the system? We think about, where does that information start and where does it land? We think about the feedback loops involved in the system and what those feedback loops can trigger.

- Then we actually have to think about change.
   How do things change in the system? When humans are making changes, how fast can they move? What is the release or development velocity? How does our data grow?
