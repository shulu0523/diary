# Design is described that how to handle the problem and how to manage complexity

# Manage Complexity
the primary goal of managing complexity is to make the system easy to maintain, extend, and reuse.

## Manage Complexity Effectively
- Easy of maintenance
- Loose coupling
- Extensibility
- Reusability
- Leanness

## How to Manage Complexity Effectively
- Division level 
  - System level
  - Subsystem level
  - Module level
  - Class level
  - Function level

## How to understand proble and division Complexity
- Find Real world objects and their relationships
- Form consistent abstractions
- Map the relationships and objects to the system
